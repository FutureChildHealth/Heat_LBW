# Heat_LBW  
Assessing the Impacts of Heat on LBW: Evidence from Low- and Middle-Income Countries  

## LBW Data  

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing national datasets from [Demographic Health Surveys][https://dhsprogram.com] and [Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys] [https://mics.unicef.org/surveys], merged with geospatial gridded meteorological data from [ERA5-Land][https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=overview], to assess the impacts of hot weather conditions on low birth weight in Pakistan. This study is the most comprehensive assessment of heat impacts on low birth weights for low- and middle-income countries.

## Methodological Overview  

We used a flexible modeling approach to account for uncertainties and spatiotemporally sparse data by applying **distributed-lag nonlinear models (DLNMs)** within a space-time series study design. We employed **generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs)** with random intercepts to account for provincial-level variation and to explore delayed and nonlinear associations between ambient temperatures and low birth weight.  

Key steps:  
- Quadratic functions were applied to address nonlinearity.  
- Model uncertainty was accounted for by predicting model-averaged outputs.  
- Province-level estimates of the heat-related attributable fraction were derived using weighted coefficients.  
- For policy implications and targeted interventions, we combined province-level estimates with district-level health and environmental indicators (e.g., live births, child mortality, poverty index, and heat index) to calculate a **district-level heat vulnerability index**.  
- Subgroups of women at the population level with higher risk of heat-related low birth weights were identified.
